easysimplified-designer is an effort to get the [monowinforms-designer](https://github.com/mono/mwf-designer) work again.

#### Current Status

The fork has removed Mono.Design to compile again.

##### CI mainfest Ubuntu
Take also a look at [the CI manifest](/.github/workflows/build.yml).

you can also use build.sh to use mono msbuild on linux

=== Windows with Visual Studio ===

Open mwf-designer.sln with Visual Studio and you are done!

=== Windows without Visual Studio ===

run winbuilddebug.bat

#### Also note:
An old version of NRefactory from Sharpdevelop (git submodule) is still used and compiled from source code. Updating to an newer version is also not recommented, because NRefactory has been archived now.
